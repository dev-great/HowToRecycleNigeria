                    </h5>
                    <p><strong>Definition:</strong>  Recycling is the process of converting waste materials into new materials and
                        objects. The recyclability of a material depends on its ability to reacquire the properties it had
                        in its original state. It is an alternative to "conventional" waste disposal that can save material
                        and help lower greenhouse gas emissions. It can also prevent the waste of potentially useful
                        materials and reduce the consumption of fresh raw materials, reducing energy use, air. pollution (from incineration) and water pollution (from landfilling).
                        </p>

                    <p><strong>Types of Recycling: </strong>There are three types of recycling, known as primary, secondary and
                        tertiary. Primary recycling means that the recyclable material/product is recovered and
                        reused without being changed in any way and usually for the very same purpose. Secondary
                        recycling means that the material/product is reused in some other way without reprocessing,
                        while tertiary recycling refers to a process that involves the chemical altering of the
                        material/product to make it reusable. Generally, recycling can be classified into Mechanical
                        recycling and chemical Recycling depending on the process of breakdown of the original
                        structure of the material.
                        </p>

                    <p><strong>Hierarchy of Controls:</strong> Recycling is a key component of modern waste reduction and is the
                        third component of the "Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle" waste hierarchy. It promotes
                        environmental sustainability by removing raw material input and redirecting waste output in
                        the economic system. There are some ISO standards related to recycling, such as ISO
                        15270:2008 for plastics waste and ISO 14001:2015 for environmental management control of
                        recycling practice.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Classification of Recyclables:</strong> Recyclable materials include many kinds of glass, paper,
                            cardboard, metal, plastic, tires, textiles, batteries, Styrofoam and electronics.
                            Composting and other reuse of biodegradable waste—such as food and garden waste—is
                            also a form of recycling. Materials for recycling are either delivered to a household recycling
                            centre or picked up from curbside bins, then sorted, cleaned, and reprocessed into new
                            materials for manufacturing new products.
